## Code Contribution Metrics (from Git History)
- **Time window:** configurable (e.g., last 12 months)
- **Outputs:**
  - `summary.csv`: per-repo totals (first/last commit, commits since window, lines added/removed/net, top file extensions)
  - `per_repo_monthly/*.csv`: commits per month per repo (for charts)

> Tip: Feed these CSVs into your site to render charts like "Commits per month", "Top languages by repo", etc.
